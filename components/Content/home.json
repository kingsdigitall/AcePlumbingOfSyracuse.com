  "faq": [
    {
      "ques": "What size dumpster do I need?",
      "ans": "The right dumpster size depends on your project. A 10-yard dumpster is great for small home cleanouts and yard debris, while a 15-20-yard dumpster works well for medium renovations and roofing projects. For large construction jobs and major remodels a 30-40 yard dumpster is the best choice."
    },
    {
      "ques": "How long can I keep the dumpster?",
      "ans": "We offer flexible rental periods to match your project needs, whether you need a dumpster for a day, a week, or longer. If you require an extension, just let us know, and we’ll arrange it at an affordable rate."
    },
    {
      "ques": "What items can I dispose of in a dumpster?",
      "ans": "You can dispose of household junk, furniture, appliances, construction debris, and yard waste. However, certain items like hazardous materials, chemicals, paint, batteries, tires, and flammable liquids are prohibited. If you’re unsure about an item, contact us for guidance."
    },
    {
      "ques": "How much does dumpster rental cost?",
      "ans": "The cost of a dumpster rental depends on the size, rental duration, and location. We offer transparent pricing with no hidden fees, ensuring you get an affordable and reliable waste disposal solution."
    },
    {
      "ques": "Do I need a permit for a dumpster rental?",
      "ans": "In some cases, you may need a permit if you’re placing the dumpster on a public street or sidewalk. Private property placements, like driveways, usually don’t require permits. Check with your local authorities or ask our team for guidance on permit requirements."
    },
    {
      "ques": "How soon can I get a dumpster delivered?",
      "ans": "We offer same-day and next-day dumpster delivery based on availability. If you need a dumpster urgently, contact us as early as possible to secure fast delivery."
    },
    {
      "ques": "What happens if I exceed the weight limit?",
      "ans": "Each dumpster has a weight limit based on the rental agreement. If you exceed this limit, there may be additional fees. To avoid overage charges, our team can help you choose the right dumpster size for your project."
    },
    {
      "ques": "Can I schedule a dumpster pickup earlier than planned?",
      "ans": "Yes! If you finish your project early and want the dumpster removed sooner, just give us a call. We’ll arrange a prompt pickup at your convenience."
    },
    {
      "ques": "Do you offer recurring dumpster rentals for businesses?",
      "ans": "Yes! We provide long-term and recurring dumpster rental services for businesses, contractors, and property managers. Whether you need weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly pickups, we can customize a plan to fit your waste disposal needs."
